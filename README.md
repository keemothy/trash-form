<h1 align='center'> Description </h1>
<p align='center'> Trashform is an AI-powered application that revolutionizes waste management through rigorous image recognition algorithms. Our users can upload their own photographs of waste items or use images online, and our system will classify the material as recyclable, compostable, or general waste. Our system will also determine the environmental impact through carbon footprint analysis and calculate the respective environmental impacts. Users will also receive recommendations for nearby recycling centers and trade-in locations where they can recycle these materials. </p>
